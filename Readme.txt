The second hud variant is way nicer. I would have used it if I had designed it first, but it was kind of last-second.

The tileset and level are entirely the ones provided (aside from enemies and triggers of course). I actually created a tileset and half of a level, but had trouble with implementation. I don't have the level any more, but the old tileset is here.

The outcome seems functional, if somewhat depressing. The dreadful splash, death and victory screens mostly come down to me burning out after the tileset was wasted.

The sound editing criteria still confuses me. I have no idea how to use sound-editing software, and I can't find a lesson in which it's covered.
